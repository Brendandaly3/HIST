- Alan Turing
	- The turing machine
		- Like a calculator but can solve sybolic things (aka a computer)
		- Uses boolean algebra
- Kelvin
	- Tabulating machine
		- Used by germany 
		- Makes people numbers
- Vannevar bush
- Programming these mashines
	- Physically have to be programmed 
- George stibitz(Bell Labs)
- Konrad Zuse
	- Was in military
	- Gets realived with the job of creating a calculator
	- Gets a company 
	- Tries to escape with the calculator strapped to his back
- Howard Aitken
	- Prof at harvard
	- Designed his own mechanical calculator
		- Similar to Zuse
		- to help with his work
	- Gives device to the military in 1937
		- Military says they dotn want it
			- Engineer wants is
				- Engineer introduces Aitken to IBM& Watson
	- Becomes naval commander
		- Staff come from navy
- Grace Hopper
	- Aitken gives Grace shit
		- 1 week to figure out how to put equations into machine
	- Tears apart whole machine and figures out how it works
		- Working at machine level 
		- Writes manual for machine (500 pages long)
	- Trains men that will take her place
	- Found first ever "bug"

- Mauchly&ENIAC
	- Electronic Numerical Intergrator and Calculator/Computer
	- Used Vaccum tube valves
		- Memo in 1942
			- Use of vaccum tubes for the use of calculating
			- Memo is lost
	- Goldstien
		- Saw a memo that said it could be done electrically
	- Secreitary recreates memo from short from notes
- Mauchly designs the computers but no way to program them
	- Pawns programming job off to women
- ENIAC SIX
	- 6 women in power
	- People dont want to buy the company
	- Bought in 1960 reporting to men that dont understand the computer

	- Women take over selling and manage to sell 42 computers in the first year
	- Built support system
	- Didnt get invite to the 50th aniversery of the computer
	- Numan has problem for ENIAC to calculate
		- They do it but dont know what it was for
		- Was nucular simulation most likely
