## what is the most powerful thing you've learned in this course
---
The most powerful thing I learned in this course is a way to make all notes and thoughts be connected. This allows me to have a better ability to connect thoughts and ideas when writing a summary or a essay on a subject. When thoughts are connected you can easily find other subjects that typically wouldn't be related and strengthen your essay arguments using those subjects.
