-   A primitive writing system used by ice age hunter-gatherers appears to have been uncovered by amateur archaeologist Ben Bacon
-   Bacon deciphered the 20,000-year-old "proto-writing" system, which predates other equivalent record-keeping systems by at least 10,000 years
-   Bacon collaborated with a team of academics from Durham University and University College London to publish a paper
-   The team deduced that the markings were a record of when animals were mating, based on their birth cycles today, and that the inclusion of a "Y" sign meant "giving birth"
-   The markings are considered a proto-writing system, not writing in the sense of pictographic and cuneiform systems that emerged later
-   The work makes the people responsible for the drawings feel "suddenly a lot closer" and the team plans to carry out further research on the meaning of other markings found in cave drawings.
