The presentation does not necessarily talk about a lack of creativity, but rather it explores how the choices made in the development of technology and tools become invisible to us once they are made, limiting our ability to imagine alternative possibilities. The presentation discusses how the tools we use shape the way we think and perceive the world, rather than limiting our creativity.

In a world where this doesnt happen there would be more solutions to the same problem allowing for even more advancement. Once something is fixed you dont try to fix it twice, like how theres no reason to re invent the wheel.
