As the article speaks on the advancements of the internet I cant help but to think about the relation this article has to my program (BIT NET). In my program I have learnt about the limitations of things like the TCP/IP protocol. I have recently learned that we are running out of IPv4 because of the sheer amount of devices connected to the internet, things like fridges, toasters, tvs, lights. The amount of devices has reached a level the creator could have never even imagined. I Think this ties into my note [[Lack of Creativity]] in the way that something was solved and not thought about except in this case it came back and bit us in the back, now we have a issue that we have to create a solution too that wouldve never been an issue if creativity wasnt limited by a solution.
