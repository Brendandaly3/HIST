## My goals of this course

My goal going into this course was to learn more about the history of the internet.

## Did I reach my goal?

I would say I reached my goal to an extent but not in the way I expected. This course was a lot more about the history of how the internet came to be then the history of the internet itself. It started off at a way earlier point in history than I had anticipated, starting with cryptography was not something I expected to be related to the creation of the internet as well as the highly in-depth class about weaving. 

## What I learned that was unexpected

I learned a lot in this course that was unexpected that I believe will be more useful in the long run than anything I anticipated learning in this course. Things such as the complex usage of obsidian which is unbelievable useful for taking notes and storing thoughts for a later date. In my eyes this course is not so much the history of the "internet" but the history of connections, and not connections in the way of human to human but the connections in the way of one thing effecting something completely unrelated to the untrained eye on the other side of the world. This whole course was about connections, interlinkages on memex, humans connecting across the Atlantic, social medias and early ways of communications like [[Packets or Pigeons]]. 

## Conclusion on the course

I am much happier with the things I learned in this course then I could've expected. I have a note taking method that will help me in the years coming in university as well as a understanding on how to relate just about anything to something else.
