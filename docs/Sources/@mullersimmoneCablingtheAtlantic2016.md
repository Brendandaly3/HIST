#### Summary & Key Take Aways

Creating a cable that was able to transfer information across the Atlantic was a much larger feat then I origianlly had thought. First they used two ships one coming from North America and one from Europe that would meet in the middle. After two attempts
with the cable snapping both times they had to attempt a different method. In this method the ships would meet in the middle then drive to each coast while sending singles to eachother to make sure the cable was still working.
