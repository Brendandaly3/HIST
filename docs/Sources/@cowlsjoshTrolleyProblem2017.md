#### Summary & Key Take Aways

In this Problem you are a train conductor that is in control of a railroad. In this scenario, if the rail conductor does nothing, five people will die, but if they switch the track, one person will die. The dilemma is the decision to switch the tracks, you have to think carefully about the ethical implications involved. Some people say that the right decision is to switch the tracks since it saves more lives, but others believe that it is unethical to take the singular person's life for the benefit of others, with the idea of “Who am I to decide whose lives are more valuable.” Where this becomes an actual issue is when you consider AI. With things like self driving cars these are real decisions AI will have to make. What is more valuable, the life of the passenger of the car or pedestrians crossing the street?
