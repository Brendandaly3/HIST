#### Summary & Key Take Aways

According to the article, IPoAC would involve attaching a data storage device (such as a USB drive) to a homing pigeon and sending the pigeon to its destination. Once the pigeon arrived, the data would be retrieved from the device and processed by the recipient.

The article goes on to describe the technical challenges involved in implementing IPoAC, including the need to ensure that the pigeons were not intercepted by predators or lost en route. The article also notes that IPoAC would be extremely slow compared to other forms of data transmission, with a theoretical maximum throughput of around 1 gigabit per day.

While the concept of IPoAC is clearly meant as a joke, the article provides an interesting commentary on the limitations of current networking technologies and the need for creative solutions to overcome these limitations.
