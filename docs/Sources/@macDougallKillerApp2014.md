### Summary & Key Take Aways
 
 Robert MacDougall's presentation talks about the Cold War through the lens of Marshall McCluen's concept. The concept is that we shape our tools, and our tools shape us. MacDougall argues that political, cultural, and social ideas become embedded in the tools and systems we use, and once those choices are made, they become invisible to us.
