Things such as the complex usage of obsidian which is unbelievable useful for taking notes and storing thoughts for a later date. In my eyes this course is not so much the history of the \"internet\" but the history of connections, and not connections in the way of human to human but the connections in the way of one thing effecting something completely unrelated to the untrained eye on the other side of the world. This whole course was about connections, interlinkages on memex, humans connecting across the Atlantic, social medias and early ways of communications like Packets or Pigeons. </p>"},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/#conclusion-on-the-course","title":"Conclusion on the course","text":"<p>I am much happier with the things I learned in this course then I could've expected.
